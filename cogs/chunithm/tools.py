        """Determine whether you can get JUSTICE / JUSTICE CRITICAL through "anmitsu" technique or rubbing the ground slider
        at the specified BPM and note density.

        ----------

        "Anmitsu" is a technique where when two notes appear on different lanes with slightly different timing, you hit both
        of them at the same time. When the two notes are close enough in timing, they will have a JUSTICE CRITICAL overlap
        duration where you can tap both notes at the exact same time and get JUSTICE CRITICAL for both. The closer the notes,
        the easier it is to perform the "anmitsu" technique. It is said that "anmitsu" technique is ideal when the distance
        between two notes is below 50ms (i.e. the JUSTICE CRITICAL overlap duration is at least 16.67ms).

        Rubbing the ground slider is a technique where when two tap notes appear in the same lane, you rub the ground slider
        instead of tapping the notes individually. If the two notes are close enough in timing, you will not get JUSTICE or
        ATTACK.
